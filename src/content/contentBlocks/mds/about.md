# Hi I'm Daniel

29 years old living and working in DÃ¼sseldorf as a FullStack Software Developer.  Programming and tinkering since I can remember, always trying to learn something new.  
Huge fan of autodidactic learning, positive that the internet can teach you mostly anything if you want to really learn!
